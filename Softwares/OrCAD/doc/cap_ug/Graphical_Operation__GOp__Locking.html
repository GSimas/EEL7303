         A schematic page often contains a large number of
        different types of objects like parts, pins, buses, wires.
        A user often needs to perform operations like adding new
        objects, changing object properties, moving, creating and
        deleting objects. All these operations require extensive
        user interaction with the Capture interface. Also, with the
        increasing complexity of designs, the number of objects on
        a page and pages in a design has increased exponentially.
        All these issues raise the need in Capture for providing a
        methodology to lock the state of a design at a particular
        point of the design process. For example, a designer should
        have the ability to maybe lock the layout of a schematic
        page.<br />
        <br />
         To address such issues, Capture includes a graphical
        operation locking (GOp) feature that allows you to lock
        objects (like components, pages, folders and even design)
        in a Capture project.<br />
        <br />
         When you graphically lock an object, the graphical aspects
        of the object are locked. This implies that non-graphical
        aspects of an object such as its properties are still
        editable. For example, if you lock a part on a schematic
        page, you cannot delete, or move the part but you can
        change, say, the PCB footprint of the part.<br />
        <br />
         GOp locking allows you to lock any object in a Capture
        design. You can lock the design, the schematic folders
        within the design, the pages within the schematic folders
        and the objects on the schematic pages.

        You can lock (and subsequently unlock) any object in a
        Capture project. You can lock the objects on a schematic
        page, the pages in a schematic folder, the folders in a
        design, and the design in a project.

             For schematic page objects, you can use the
            multi-select feature on the schematic page to select
            and lock multiple objects simultaneously.<br />
             For project manager objects (pages, folders and
            designs), you select the objects in project manager.

          in the pop-up menu.&#160;When you lock a schematic page
          object the look-and-feel of the object when it is
          selected is changed.&#160;When you lock a project manager

          The object cannot be deleted or cut.

        <li>
          The object cannot be moved to another part of the page
          (using a cut-and-paste operation or a mouse drag
          operation).
        </li>
        <li>
          The object cannot be moved to another page (using a

          operation).
        </li>
        <li>
          The object can be copied to another page or as another
          instance on the current page. However, the copied
          instance of the object is locked as soon as you paste it
          on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the locked object is a part, the part editor for the
          object is inaccessible. This means that the menu option
          to open the part editor for a locked part is unavailable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The replace or update cache operations will fail if they
          effect a locked part. Say a design contains multiple
          instances of a part where some instances are locked and
          some are unlocked. In this case, the replace or update
          cache operations on a part with multiple instances will
          fail if these operations effect the locked instances.
          This means that these operations will not update even on
          the unlocked part instances.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Update All operation on an unlocked part instance
          (executed in the edit part procedure) will fail if this
          operation effects a locked part instance. This means that
          this operation will not effect even on the unlocked part
          instances.<br />
           Since, this type of locking is graphical so you are
          still permitted to edit the properties of a locked part.
          This implies that you can open the property editor for a
          locked object and add, modify or delete properties on the
          part.

           Note: However, if you run these commands on a locked
          design, and this causes a graphical change in the design,
          Capture allows the change but it will immediately be
          locked onto the design.<br />
           Say you run the DRC on a locked design (or the DRC
          effects locked objects in the design). If the design has
          any DRC errors or warnings, Capture allows the process to
          place the markers even on locked object of the design.
          However, if a marker is placed on a locked page, the
          marker is immediately locked and you will need to either
          unlock the page or the marker if you need to remove the
          marker.

        When you lock a container object (a page, a folder, or a
        design), all the objects within the container are also
        locked. Also, this process cascades down to the lowest
        level object.<br />
         So, if you lock a page, all the objects on the page are
        locked. If you lock a folder, all the pages contained in
        the folder are locked. In addition, the objects on each of
        the pages are locked.

                Unlocking has the same cascading effect on a

      <p>
        When you lock a container object, you can unlock specific
        objects within the locked container by explicitly unlocking
        these. However, since locking and unlocking does not cause
        a roll-up effect, the unlock operation does not unlock the
        object container.<br />
        <br />
         When you lock a container object, a lock symbol appears
        over the container icon in the Project manager. Now, if you
        explicitly unlock one or more objects within the locked
        container, the lock symbol remains but it changes to an
        open lock. This indicates that the container is locked but
        one or more objects within the container are
        unlocked.<br />
        <br />
         The locking operation on an object within a container is
        specific to the object. This implies that the lock (or
        unlock) operation on an object overrides the operation on
        the object container. Consider the example of a folder,
        SCHEMATIC1, containing two pages, PAGE1 and PAGE2.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lock PAGE2.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lock SCHEMATIC1.<br />
           Since locking is a cascading operation, locking
          SCHEMATIC1 effects the lock status of its pages. In this
          case, since PAGE2 is assigned locked state, so the
          cascading operation will effect only PAGE1.<br />
           The lock operation did not effect PAGE2 not because the
          page was already locked but because the lock (or unlock)
          state on an object overrides the locked (or unlocked)
          state of the container.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlock SCHEMATIC1.<br />
           Again, due to the cascading effect of unlocking, the
          pages within SCHEMATIC1 are unlocked.<br />
           However, since PAGE2 was locked specifically and not as
          part of the cascading lock on SCHEMATIC1, the cascading
          lock operation will not effect the lock state of PAGE1.
        </li>
      </ol>

                Locking (or unlocking) a container does not
                necessarily imply that the state of the entire
                contents of the container will be effected by
                operation. So objects within the container are
                assigned their own lock (or unlock) state.
