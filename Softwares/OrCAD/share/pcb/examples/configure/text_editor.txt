This describes how to change the default texteditor used by the Allegro
back-end products.

Certain Allegro features (e.g. SI) utilize a text editor. The Skill
API supports the ability to launch an editor via axlUIEditFile.

The editor invoked by Allegro uses the following OS level env variables
(rank in order of precedence). One can be set in the Allegro env file but 
these variables are UNIX standard env variables used by other applications.
        1) WINDOW_EDITOR (UNIX/Linux only)
        2) VISUAL
        3) EDITOR

If none is set the default editor is:
        UNIX: vi
        Windows: pe_wordpad (provided in the Cadence install hierarch)

Set WINDOW_EDITOR if you have a GUI editor. Gvim and xemacs are examples of 
GUI editors while vi, vim and emacs require a controlling terminal window.

CAUTIONS:
  1) On Windows, certain editors (e.g. winword) do not save files in
     Ascii format. It is suggested that the editor you choose saves
     a file, by default, as a ".txt" file.
  2) On Windows, other editors (e.g notepad) cannot handle UNIX formatted
     text files. If you operate heterogeneous environment do not use
     these editors.
  3) On Windows, some embeddded text editors (e.g. wordpad) may limit the 
     size of the file you can edit.
