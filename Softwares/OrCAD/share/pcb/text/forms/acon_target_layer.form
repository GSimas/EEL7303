# Keep the TPANEL values at 1 for both Tiles, otherwise an ugly gap will
# appear with this Top tile, which is intended to be off the form anyway.

# Add a cancel button, but move it off the screen in a negative direction.
# This is needed to allow scripting to work properly.
# Even though there is no visible cancel button on the form, this is
# the button that will appear in the script file if the user Xs out the form
# (on Windows) or does File Close (on unix).
# Set to y=-3, otherwise a number closer to zero will cause a piece of the
# button to show.
