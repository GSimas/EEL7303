# PCR 882520 - The bitmap "window" size is defined in the FSIZE
# command, as in "FSIZE <x> <y>", where <x> is the number of
# characters wide, and <y> is the number of characters tall. This is
# not convenient for us because:
#
# (a) Bitmap sizes are typically known in pixels, and "characters" is not
#     very applicable, unless you know "pixels per character"
#     measures.
#
# (b) "Pixels per character" changes on a per desktop basis, so two users can
#     have two settings.
#
# For example, this was originally developed on a Windows XP system
# with desktop settings of "Normal Fonts" and a 1280 x 1024 screen,
# and a DPI of "Normal Size (96 dpi)". For this set-up, an FSIZE of 40
# (x) and 15 (y) gave a bitmap window of 320 pixels by 165 pixels,
# indicating that the character size is roughly 8 pixels per x, and 11
# pixels per y.
#
# The PCR reported that the 320 x 165 bitmaps were truncated on the
# sides, and looked like they were trying to fit in a area of 280 x
# 165 pixels. Working backwards, we get the idea that the computer is
# using characters that are 7 by 11 instead of 8 by 11. On further
# investigation, we find it is using a screen size of 1024 x 768,
# which leads to the difference.
#
# So, all we can really do is figure out the minimum recommended
# configuration, (1024 x 768, 96dpi), set the FSIZE parameters
# accordingly, (FSIZE 46 15) and any users who have settings larger
# than the minimum may see the bitmpas centered in a 'too big' bitmap
# window. But that is better than having a two small window in the
# minimum case.
