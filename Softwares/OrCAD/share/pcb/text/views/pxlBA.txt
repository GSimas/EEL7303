# pxlBA.txt : Extract file used to extract properties for
#             back annotation using packagerxl. Refer to Allegro extract
#             documentation for more details on the syntax of this file
#             and the Extract program.
#
#             The lines starting with # are comments.
#             The default version of this file extracts the minimum number
#             of properties necessary to ba changes to packaging.
#             To extract additional properties the user must remove the
#             comment character '#' from the appropriate lines. Or
#             add a line with the property name to the appropriate section.

#             It is recommended for company wide backannotation settings
#             that this file be located @ <cds_site>/pcb/extacta
