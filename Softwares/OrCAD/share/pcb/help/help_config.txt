# This file allows the registration of help documents for new user commands
# or to override the default Cadence help for existing commands.
#
# Cadence will sometimes use this mechanism for documenting functionality developed
# outside the regular release process.
#
# Format:
#    <cmd name>  file= <name of file>
#      variable expansion is supported in the file name portion
#          CADENCE entries should use
#		file= $allegro_install_dir/help/<filename>
#
#   If you wish to associate help with a form help button use the format:
#	form.<formname>
#		do NOT use the .form file extension
#
#   Supported help file extensions: 
#	txt, pdf, html  - Windows and UNIX
#	Windows supports other extenions (e.g. doc) based upon the programs 
#		that are installed on a user's machine.
#
# Example (override add line) with file located in PCB's CDS_SITE
#    add line   file= $ALLEGRO_SITE/help/README.txt
# add help for status form
#    form.status file= $TELENV
#
# If a customer needs to add their own entries add a file with this name at:
#     customer site level: <cds_site>/pcb/help/help_config.txt
#     per user:	           <pcbenv>/help_config.txt
#
# Default Allegro cds_site is <cdsroot>/share/local/pcb
#
# You can also add entries dynamically via Skill, see axlUIWHelpRegister.
#
# Add entries after this line.
