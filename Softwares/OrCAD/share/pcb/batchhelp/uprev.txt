Command line arguments for Allegro database uprev program
	Database upreving utility. Used to uprev one or multiple databases
	in a batch environment. Typically used when migrating to a major
	release and the need exists to uprev all symbol libraries.

        Has two formats; single databases (format 1) and multiple databases with
	traversing directories as needed (format 2). Format 2 replaces the
	uprev_overwrite utility that performed this functionality in previous
	releases. The -b option tells the program to use format 2 mode instead
	of the default format 1.

	This is a wrapper to the dbdoctor program that processes each database.

FORMAT 1: Uprev one database. If output filename is provided then will result
	the result of uprev into the it, leaving the input unchanged.

    uprev [<args>] <input database> [<output filename>]

    Example: uprev -d foo.brd out.brd
	Uprev and do a batch drc on foo.brd and write result into out.brd

    Example: uprev  foo.brd 
	Uprev foo.brd, overwrite it with updated database


FORMAT 2: Uprev multiple databases. You can provide both databases and
	directories to the command. If a directory is encountered, uprev 
	will recursively enter that directory and all its child directories 
	until it encounters the nest directory depth limit or a read-only 
	directory.  It will only process known Allegro database extensions 
	and directories, all other names will be ignored.

	If no names are provided will process all files in current working
	directory and all sub-directories. Give "-n 1" if you only want
	the current directory.  All databases will be uprev in place 
	(overwritten).

    uprev [<args>] [-n <directory depth>] <files or directories...>

    Example: uprev -b 
	Uprev all databases in current directory and any child directories
	up to a depth of 3.

    Example: uprev -b  *
	Same as previous example

    Example: uprev -b  *.pad
	Uprev only padstacks found in current directory

    Example: uprev -b  -d -n 1 symbols padstacks
	Uprev and perform batch DRC on all databases found in "symbols" and
	"padstacks" directories and any child directories. Do not descend
	to any sub-directories.

    GENERIC ARGUMENTS
	[-drc]
	      Updates all DRC's, including BATCH only.
	[-D]
	      Runs command in debug mode. Output what it is going to do.
	[-b]
	      Enable format 2 mode (default is format 1)

    FORMAT 1 ARGUMENTs
	<input board> 
		name of database; must provide an extension
	[<output filenae>]
		optional filename

    FORMAT 2 ARGUMENTs
	[-n <nest directory depth>]
		Maximum depth to descend into a directory tree
        <files or directories...>
