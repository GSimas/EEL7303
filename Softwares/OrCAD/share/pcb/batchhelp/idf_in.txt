Command line arguments for idf_in: 
    Translates design outline and component placement information from Intermediate 
    Data Format (IDF) for use in an electrical design. You can import data into a 
    new design or into an existing design.

    For additional information, see the Transferring Logic Design Data user guide
    in your documentation set.

    Based on the mechanical system used, the editor looks for the file extensions described 
    below:
      PTC  - <idf file>.emn
      SDRC - <idf file>.out
      IDF  - <idf file>.bdf

    Any error or warning messages are stored in the idf_in.log file.

idf_in [-d <name_type>] <idf data file> [-o <output design>] [-i <input design> -[a[p|m|f]] 


    OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
        [-d <name_type>]
              Switch specifying the name of the mechanical system.  <name_type> can be one 
	      of the following: PTC, SDRC, or IDF.
	      Default: IDF

        [-o <output design>]
              The name of the output design database to be created/updated by idf_in. 
              Default: <drawing_name>.brd

        [-i <input design>]
              The name of the input design database to be updated by import. If no
	      output name is given the input design is overwritten.
              Default: <draing_name>.brd

        [-p]
              Generates a .dra file of type symbol package.
	      Output design name is: <drawing_name>.dra

        [-m]
              Generates a .dra file of type symbol mechanical.
	      Output design name is: <drawing_name>.dra

        [-f]
              Generates a .dra file of type symbol format.
	      Output design name is: <drawing_name>.dra

        [-a <number>]  The accuracy that is the number of decimal places.
              Range is 0 to 4.
              Default: 3
       
    REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:
        <idf data file>
              Name of the IDF Data File. If no extension is given,
              then the <name_foramt> determines the file's extension. 

	The -p, -m, or -f arguments may not be combined.
             
EXAMPLES:

- This command creates or updates the in_test board file by reading the IDF file
  test.out. The -d SDRC argument indicates that the IDF file (test) extension is .out.
	idf_in -d SDRC -o in_test test

- This command creates or updates the in_test.dra file by reading the IDF file
  test.emn. The -d SDRC argument indicates that the IDF file extension is .emn. The -p
  argument indicates the generation of a .dra file.
	idf_in -d PTC -p -o in_test test

- This command shows an example using only the required argument. The IDF file is
  test. Because there is no -d <name_type> argument, the default is IDF. The IDF file 
  extension is .bdf. Because there is no outname argument, the current design name, test, 
  is used.
	idf_in test
