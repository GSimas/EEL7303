MUST BE DOWNREVVED TO 14.2 AND IS NOT INTENDED AS PART OF THE STANDARD 
DESIGN PROCESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAIN DATA WILL BE

OVERVIEW:

"downrev14" downrevs a 15.0 board to 14.2. If the design is from a later 15.x
version, then perform the following command:

File->Export->Save Design to 15.0

Following this, run this 'downrev14' utility to take it down to 14.2.

It will downrev a 15.0 board to 14.2 only if the board has no 15.0 specific 
database elements. If downrev14 encounters 15.0 specific database elements, 
it will print information about those element in the logfile. It is users 
responsibility to fix those issues in 15.0 before attempting to downrev 
to 14.2.


SYNTAX FOR THE BATCH COMMAND:
    downrev14 <15.0 board> -outfile <14.2 name>

  . This works only on one board at a time
  . This creates a log file - <15.0 board>.log

Information about objects that need be fixed in 15.0 before the board can 
be downreved to 14.2.

LENGTHS
-------
  NAME		    14.2 MAX	  15.0 MAX
  ----------------------------------------
  group name	    31		  200
  pad stack	    18		  255
  net name	    31		  255
  bus name          31            200

  - if any name is found to be larger then the 14.2 MAX,
    downrev14 will print out the information and the user
    will have to change the name so it is 14.2 compatible
    and run downrev14 again.  An exception will be a BUS_NAME,
    it is deleted.

SUBCLASSES
----------
  o subclass increase from 127 to 253.
    if any objects on a subclass > 127 then downrev
    fails, user has to remove objects on those
    subclasses and then the subclasses.

PROPERTIES
----------
  o Any Attribute/Property whose definition doesn't exist in 14.2 will 
    be deleted.
  o If # of chars in ATR_BUS_NAME is > 31 then it will be deleted.

  
PARAMETER RECORDS
-----------------
  o Any parameter record whose definition doesn't exists in 14.2 will 
    be deleted.
  o Any parameter record whose revision has changed from 14.2 to 15.0 
    will also be deleted.
    
    Following parameter record will be downrevved.
    - layer_parm_type

    Following parameter records will be deleted.

    o awb_parm_type
    o ministat_parm_type
    o probe_parm_type
    o rt_gen_parm_type
    o grid_parms_type
    o rt_ins_parm_type

DIFFPAIRS
---------
  o All diffpairs will be deleted from the board.


PADSTACKS
---------
  o If we find any names that are longer then the 14.2 max, downrev14 will 
    fail and inform the user that he has to change the names.


BOUNDARY CLASS
--------------
  o If dynamic shapes are found in the board, attempt will be made to
    delete all dynamic shape groups, but leave the underlying
    etch shapes. If any object are still left on boundary class, 
    downrev14 will fail and user will have to remove them.


DRC
---
  o We will leave DRC's out of date.
