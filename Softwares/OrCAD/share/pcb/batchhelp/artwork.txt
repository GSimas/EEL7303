Command line arguments for artwork
	 Generates films from Allegro boards.

artwork [-s -p <-o outline_offset> <-a min_aperture>] 
		[-f <filmname1> -f <filmname2> -f...] <board>
   OR
artwork -l <board>

	[-s]
	    Array outside of the shapes is not to be filled on a 
	    negative film.
	[-p] 
	    Use vector pad-type behavior for raster artwork.
	[-o <outline_offset>] 
	    Applies to negative films. Adds another outline around
	    the design outline extending the shape boundary of
	    the filled area. This new artwork outline extends in
	    all directions beyond the design outline.
	    Default is "Shape bound box" obtained from the film record.
	    Value must be given in mils.
	[-a <min_aperture>] 
	    For vector artwork, uses this as the minimum aperture.
	    Default is 3 mils. min_aperture is an integer number whose 
	    units must be given in mils. Fractional numbers is not
	    supported and you must round the value to the nearest integer.

	    Normally we use the smallest aperature defined in the
	    or 3 mils whatever is larger. This allows you to set the
	    default smaller then 3 mils. Do NOT attempt to use this
	    to set a larger value then 3 mils.

	    This option is NOT recommended.
	[-f <filmname1> -f <filmname2> -f...] 
	    Films to genrerate from artwork control record. Default
	    is to generate all films.
	[-l] 
	    list films in board; one per line

	<board> An Allegro .brd or .mcm file
