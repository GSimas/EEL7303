create_sym  [options] <input dra> [<output symbol>] 
    Creates (compiles) a symbol from a dra file. In order to use
    symbols in an Allegro board you must first create them from
    a DRA. This is the command line version of File->Create Symbol.

    options:
            -m or -b, create a mechanical symbol      {.bsm}
            -p, create a package symbol               {.psm}
            -f or -o, create a format symbol          {.osm}
            -s, create an pad shape symbol            {.ssm}
            -t, create a thermal flash shape symbol   {.fsm}
 
            only one of the above options can be set, if none
            are present then uses the default value set in the
	    dra file.
 
    <input dra> - the name of a .dra file, 
 
    <output symbol> - optional, the name of the symbol file.  
	    If none is present the name will be created based on 
	    the option and the dra name.
