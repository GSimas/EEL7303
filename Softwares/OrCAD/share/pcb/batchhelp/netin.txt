Command line arguments for netin
	Inputs third party netlists (Telesis) to a design database
	or does a syntax check on the netlist and device files.

	If importing logic indicates problems with device file
	problems then run netin in syntax check mode for more
	detailed data on the errors.

Import Logic:
  netin [-aA|-bB|-cC|-dD|-eE|-g|-s|-v|-x|-y <number>|z] <netlist> 
		[input_drawing] [output_drawing]

Synax Check Mode:
  netin <netlist>

Arguments and Switches:
    -a or -A Creates an A size drawing.
    -b or -B Creates a B size drawing.
    -c or -C Creates a C size drawing.
    -d or -D Creates a D size drawing.
    -e or -E Creates an E size drawing.
    -g	 Run gate assign
    -i   Obsolete
    -s   Supersedes all logical data with the new netlist.
    -v   Prevents creation of device log files.
    -x   Corresponds to the Allow Etch Removal During ECO field on the
         Netlist-In form. Use the x switch to rip up etch during an ECO.
    -y <number> Corresponds to the Placed Changed Components in Design radio 
	buttons on the Netlist-In form. 
		-y 1 = Always
		-y 2 = If/Same
		-y 3 = Never
    -z   Ignore FIXED property when updating design.

    <netlist> Is the name of the input file.

    <input_drawing> Optional drawing name into which the netlist data is
	to be loaded. You do not need to type in the .brd file extension. 
	This field is optional, if no argument is specified, netin assumes
	you only want a syntax check the netlist.

    <output_drawing> Optional output drawing. If not specified input drawing
	is overwritten.

Note: If neither the input nor the output drawing is specified, netin runs in 
   a syntaxcheckonly mode. This is a fast method for checking for syntax errors 
   in the netlist file and device files.
