Command line arguments for netrev
	Inputs Cadence netlist files into Allegro (pst files)

	By default netrev runs in HDL mode.

netrev [<args>] [<input brd>] [<output brd>]

    GENERIC ARGUMENTS
	[-e]
	    Normally netrev reports missing Allegro footprints as warnings. 
	    This switch makes this an error. Used for library development.
	[-i <directory>] 
	    Optional flag indicating where to find the .pst files. If the 
	    given project file uses the -proj option, netrev looks in the 
            directory specified by the "view_packager global directive in 
	    the project file. If no project file is specified, netrev 
	    looks in the current working directory. The -i argument 
	    overrides the project file. 
	[-n] 
	    generate new board (input board name specifies new board name)
	[-t] 
	    Generate xml file for design compare. xml file name is 
	    u_sch.xml. This is based on the contents of the pst files.
	[-x] 
	     Rip up connecting etch when ripping up components during an ECO. 
             See -r for ripup options.
	[-r 1|2|3] 
	     Rip up options available when rip up is enabled (-x):
                 1 = Delete the first etch-segment only.
                 2 = Retain bondwires for wirebonded components, but delete
                     connecting etch beyond the bondfingers.
                 3 = Both 1 and 2, retain bondwires and delete the first
                     etch segment beyond the bondfingers.
	[-y 1|2|3|4|5]
	     Symbol placement code that indicates how symbols are 
	     replaced if ripped up during an ECO: 
                 1 = Always replace the symbol (default mode). 
                 2 = Replace the symbol only if it is the same symbol as 
                     was there originally. 
                 3 = Never replace the symbol. 
                 4 = Do not rip up the symbol; instead, deassign it. 
		     (This has the effect of turning it into a non-logic
            	     bearing component.) 	
                 5 = Replace symbol even if there is change in component 
		     and symbol definitions, if the pins match.
	[-u]
	     create schematic user-defined properties in Allegro. Default
	     is to not create property definitions for those properties
	     not already defined in the design.
	[-z] 
	     Ignore fixed property. This allows the program to replace
	     symbols, ripup etch, etc. event if they are fixed in the board
	[-f <file>]
		if specified, constraint difference report will be written in
		DD format (i.e. to be shown by firefox-based viewer) to this
		file 
	[-v]
		Launch constraint difference report viewer to show differences in
		DD format (navigable). Report will be written to temporary file.

    SCALD ONLY
	[-g]
	     packager files are SCALD based
	[-s <schematic path>] 
	     The path to the schematic directory

    HDL ONLY
	[-l]	
	    Prevents changing to the pstDirectory if running with the
	    -proj option
	[-proj <project file>] 
	    The HDL project file -- typically with a cpm extension
	[-u]	
	    Allows property definitions to be created from the netlist. 

    ConceptHDL Flow ONLY (not applicable if running with Capture)
	[-o] 
	    Overwrite current electrical constraints if in Constraint Manager
	    Enabled flow. Default mode (no -o) is to import changes only. 
	    If not in Constraint Manager flow this option is ignored.

    GENERIC
	[<input board>] 
		- start editing with this database (ignore ini file)
		- default extensions .brd, .mcm, .dra, .mdd
	[<output board>] 
		- output allegro database. If none is provided the
		  input database is overwritten.

    OBSOLETE Options (kept for backwards compatibility but ignored)
	[-5] 
	    Indicates HDL mode. As of 16.0 this is the default mode.
	[-c]  Composer logic mode. Used if .pst files were generated from 
	     Composer.
	[-p <layout path>] Path to the input board
	[-d]  Turn on dependency management.
	[-m] 
	    Migration mode, used only if migrating a SCALD design to HDL. 
	    When -m is actived, netrev attempts to migrate a SCALD design 
	    to HDL using .pst files. The layout must match the schematic 
	    for migration to be successful. If design changes are found, 
	    the process stops with an error.
