Usage: mkdeviceindex [-d] [-o ndxfile] dmlfile | dir | - [...]
   
   Indexes models found in the SigNoise libraries listed on the
   command line. The resulting index is more quickly loaded by SigNoise.
   
   Only models that pass a syntax check are indexed. If the -d option
   is given, IBIS device models will be indexed only if they pass
   the syntax check, and all of the IOCell and Package models that
   they depend on also pass the check
   
   The output file defaults to device.ndx, but a different name can
   be specified with the -o option. The .ndx extension is added if not
   supplied. If the output file already exists, new entries are appended.
   
   Remaining command line arguments are one of:
   - SigNoise library files, usually with a .dml extension.
   - Directories, which are recursively searched for .dml files.
   - The special name - which causes the standard-input to be read for
     a list of libraries.

   Example: mkdeviceindex -d -o mydmls *.dml dmldir
