NC Route Generator:
	ncroute [<args>] [<design>]

   Arguments
	[-q]   - suppress verbose messages (this is the default)
	[-v]   - enable verbose messages
	[-o <route file>]   - Output route file name (default extension .rou). 
			Default name is <design>.rou
			If seperate route files are specified for unplated vs. plated then
			two rou files are generated with "_plated"  appended to the route file 
			name for the plated output.
	[-n <alt_name>] - if present substitue alt_name for the design name in output files.
			The default is the <design> name. This option is not typically 
			used.

   <design> - design file to generate nc route from

   Other notes:
	- Expects to find "nc_param.txt" file located based on NCDPATH. This controls
	  additional ncroute settings. If not found uses Cadence defaults.
	  Allegro NCRoute Dialog vs. nc_param.txt file contents:
	     Seperate files for plated/non-plated routing: SEPARATE-ROUTING - YES/NO 
	     Route feedrate:  FEEDRATE - <value> 
	- Expects to find ncroutebits.txt if not found generates one called 
	  ncroutebits_auto.txt
	- Requires a BOARD GEOMETRY/NCROUTE_PATH layer in the design.
