	 environment variable.
    -s - short output (only A record)
    -w - don't include the date in output file
    -z - in non-net views generate a unique net name for items on dummy net
    -A - list all database attachments in the design (1) 
	 This option supports no other options: 
	     extracta -A [<drawing>]
    -a <name> - extract named attachment to file <name>.dat. Multiple 
		attachments can be obtained by placing multiple -a <name>
		options on command line (1).
	 This option supports no other options: 
	     extracta -a <attachmentName1> ...  [<drawing>]

   <drawing> - name of allegro database
   <cmdfile> - name of extract command file. Uses TEXTPATH to locate
                file if relative path is given
   <outfile>... - name of output file. If multiple views are given
               in the cmdfile then one output file is needed for
               each file. If no outfile files are given then
               output is dumped to stdout. A maximum of 24 files is 
	       supported.
