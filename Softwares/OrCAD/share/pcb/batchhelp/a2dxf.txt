Command line arguments for a2dxf. 
        Utility to export mechanical data from Allegro to DXF.

a2dxf [-uabdfnmhspl] <cnv> <dxf> <brd>

    OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
        [-u]  Output units. The Allegro unit of measure.
              Valid args: MILS, INCHES, CM, MM, MICRONS
              default: Allegro database units.

        [-a]  Accuracy. Number of decimal places.
              Valid args:  0 - 4 
              default:  Allegro database accuracy.

        [-b]  Block switch. If set, string that follows indicates
                             what elements should be exported as blocks.
              Valid args: S (symbols) and/or P (padstacks). 
              Example: -b SP to export both symbols and padstacks as blocks.
              default: off

        [-d]  Drill info switch. Export Allegro NC_DRILL data.
	      If any MANUFACTURING classe with a leading string of "NC"
	      appears in the mapping file (cnv) then this option is automatically
	      enabled.
              default: off

        [-n]  No multi-segment polyline switch. Export each segment of
              a line or cline as a separate DXF POLYLINE. 
              default: off 

        [-m]  Monochrome switch. Make all DXF layers one color (white). 
              default: off 

        [-f]  Format. DXF format revision to write. 
              Valid args: 12, 14
              default: 12

        [-h]  Default package height. Specifies the value to use
              for package height when none is defined. The numerical
              value must be consistent with the specified DXF units.
              Valid args:  any decimal number greater than 0.
              default: 0.0

        [-l]  When writing a r14 file, specifies whether multi-segment
              line objects should be generated as shapes instead of 
              polyline objects. These shapes will then be filled or
              hollow outlines depending on the -s flag presence
              (see below). This may incur a small performance penalty
              when viewing the resulting DXF file.
              default: off
              
        [-s]  Draw solid-fill shape objects as filled.

              If exporting a revision 12 format, the value must be 
              specified in DXF units and represents the line width to 
              use for fill. User is responsible for providin a value which
              is usable for all objects in the design.
              
              If exporting revision 14, the value is ignore and the shape
              will be filled using a DXF HATCH record.

              Valid args: numeric value greater than 0.
              default: off (unfilled).

        [-p]  Draw pad shape objects as filled.

              If exporting a revision 12 format, the value must be 
              specified in DXF units and represents the line width to 
              use for fill. User is responsible for providin a value which
              is usable for all objects in the design.
              
              If exporting revision 14, the value is ignore and the pad
              will be filled using a DXF HATCH record.

              Valid args: numeric value greater than 0.
              default: off (unfilled).
              

    REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
        <cnv>  Layer conversion file. ASCII text file that specifies
               the mapping of DXF layer to Allegro class/subclass.

        <dxf>  Name of the DXF file.

        <brd>  Name of the design file.
