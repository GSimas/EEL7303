     dbstat [-v] [-p] [-t] <filename.ext> ... <designM>

Dbstat reports the Allegro design revision and platform architecture.

Dbstat supports the following file types (extensions):
      .brd .mdd .mcm .sip 
      .mdd .dpf .dpm .dps .scf 
      .pad .dra .mcm .psm .ssm .fsm, .bsm

Options:
    -v - Database version of design
    -t - Report last saved tiering level. This is NOT the same as the last
	product/option(s) active during saving the design. Instead it is the 
	equivalent product and options that match the DRC in effect when the 
	design was saved.
    -p - The architecture on which the design was last saved (UNIX or NT) 
	UNIX: big-endian systems (SPARC, PA-RISC)
	NT: Little-endian systems (Intel or AMD)  (Windows, Linux, Sol86)
	    This means it reports NT for saved designs on Linux.
    -e - Editing time and last user (login) who saved design. Same as data reported
	in status dialog. Edit time is in minutes

The reported database version of the design may NOT be the same as the 
version of Allegro used to save the database. The version reported by
dbstat is the earliest version of Allegro that can open the design. If
you do not use the capability of latter Allegro dot releases then
the database revision is not changed.

Dbstat accepts the wildcard character *.<ext> to report on multiple designs.

Note:  For padstack (.pad) designs saved prior to version 10, dbstat 
	returns the message, "Pre-rev 10 pad file." 

Example: dbstat test.brd
     returns information similar to the following:
         test.brd: 16.0 UNIX
