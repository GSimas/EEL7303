Safe Mode Option

Many Allegro programs support the "-safe" command line option. This
starts the program without any user customizations or extensions.
This can be used a debug mechanism to eliminate if user configurations
are the cause of the problem with the product.

It disables loading at startup
   - local env file (<HOME>/pcbenv/env)
   - cds_site configuration data
   - any user skill code
   - pre-register scripts
   - ini file which stores windown size/positon information 
   - most recent used files (MRU)
   - remembered Windows positions (.geo files)

UNIX: Currently it cannot disable X window resource settings.

In addition graphic programs support the "-noopengl" option which
will disable the enhanced Graphics based upon OpenGL.

Example: Run an "out of the box" allegro without opengl

	allegro -safe -noopengl
