		  on-line documents for full description.

	[<allegro design>]

Notes:
	If no scripts are specified on command line (-s or -S options)
	and environment variable "script_startup" has a value then
	we will replay a script in startup directory with name
		<program>_<script_startup_value>.scr
	Example for allegro if variable script_startup=foo then
	script would be allegro_foo.scr
