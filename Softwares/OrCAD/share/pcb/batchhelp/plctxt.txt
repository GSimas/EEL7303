plctxt [-r] [-s] [-c|p] [-o] [-m] [-z] <in_design> [<out_design>] [<place_text_file>]

Plctxt operates in two modes:
  1) Create a place text file containing the refdes, origin, rotation,
     mirror status, and embedded layer for all placed parts in a design. 
  2) Utilizes an existing place text file to place a board. Will not
     effect already place parts.

Note: 
    Place text will not save nor place mechanical or format symbols.

Arguments:
    -r: reads from <place_text_file> placement positions of parts specified

    -s: If errors deteched when placing then continue processing all
	data in place text file and save design.

    -m: Move the existing components if any. By default, add unplaced components only.

    -z: Ignore the FIXED property, work with the option "-m".

    -o: Create a place text file in old format supported in release 16.3-

    Optionally arguments, if neither present then uses symbol origin:
    -c: Places symbol so its body center or subclass BODY_CENTER point
	occurs at the point specified in the <place_text_file>
    -p: Places sybmol by origin of Pin 1 location.

    In_design: input design name
    Out_design: (optional) If not present overwrites in_design.

    place_text_file: Default name is place_txt.txt. If name is provided
		you MUST also provide and out_design name.
