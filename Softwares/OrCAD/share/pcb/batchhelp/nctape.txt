NC Tape Generator
	nctape [<args>] [<design>]

   Arguments
	[-b]   - enable backdrill. Design must be set-up for backdrilling
	[-l]   - enable drill by layer. Output drill multiple drill files
		 for each layer of design (example <brd>-bl-1-2.drl, <brd>-bl-2-3.drl)
	[-n <outfile>] - if present will override nc_param.txt TAPE-FILE
			parameter used in generating base .drl name
			and output directory
	[-o]   - reduce drill head travel path to increase efficiency
	[-q]   - suppress verbose messages (this is the default)
	[-s <scale>]   - Scales (x y) locations. All x/y locations in
			drill file will be multiplied by this scale value.
	[-v]   - enable verbose messages

   <design> - design file to generate


   Other notes
	- Expects to find "nc_param.txt" file via in NCDPATH which controls
	  additional tape out settings.
	- Generates one or more drl extension files with the following
	  name convention:
	     <name>-<l1>-<l2>-<type><plate><-len>.drl
		where
		  name - basename of FILE parameter in "nc_param.txt" 
		  l1     - number of drill start layer
		  l2     - number of drill end layer
		  type   - either laser, plasma, punch or other (from
				padstack definition)
		  plate  - if non-plated add "-np"
		  len    - adds -len<number> if need to break up single
			   file into multiple files due to exceeding file LENGTH
			   specified in nc_param.txt
	  Example a 6 layer board call with "TAPE-FILE of "/home/xyz/u.drl" 
	  would have drill files of following names output to /home/xyz directory:
		u-1-6-laser-np.drl
		u-1-6-plasma.drl
		etc.
