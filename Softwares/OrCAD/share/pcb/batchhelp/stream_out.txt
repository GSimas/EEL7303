Command line arguments for stream_out. 
        Utility to export physical data from Allegro to GDSII (Stream) Format.

stream_out [-udon [f|r|s] p2RCt] <-c filename.cnv> <brd>

    OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
        [-u]  Output units.  The Allegro unit of measure.
              Valid args: MILS, INCHES, CM, MM, MICRONS
              default: Allegro database units.

        [-d]  Accuracy specified in database units per user unit
              Valid args:  integer powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, ...) 
              default: Allegro database accuracy. 

        [-o]  Output file.  Name of the resultant stream file.
              Default: <design_name>.sf

        [-n]  Top structure name.  Name of the top GDSII Structure.
              NOTE: The name is limited to 32 characters. 
              Default: STR_1

        [-f | -r | -s]
              Path endpoint style.  (f)lush, (r)ound, or (s)quare.
              Default: -r

        [-p]  Flat geometry.  When present, stream data is written flat,
              i.e. without hierarchy.
              Default:  off. (Program outputs hierarchical data).

        [-2]  Dracula Format.  Output a GDSII file compatible with the 
              Dracula program.

        [-R]  Rectangle format.  When present, all rectangles are exported
              as GDSII Boundaries.  When not present, unfilled rectangles
              are exported as GDSII Paths; filled rectangles are exported
              as GDSII Boundaries. 
              Default:  off. 

        [-C]  Cline as boundary.  When present, all clines are exported
              as GDSII Boundaries.  When not present, clines are exported
              as GDSII Paths.
              Default:  off. 

        [-t]  Text height as magnification.  When present the text height
              is written into the magnification field in user units.
       
        [-a]  The number of segments per circle to be used when converting
              arcs to segments.
              Valid args: 3 ... 360
              default: 32
              NOTE:  Users should be aware that specifying a high value will
              increase the size of the output file and may produce very 
              small segments.  Only the default value is recommended for 
              manufacturing.  Cadence does not support importing files
              that were produced with a non-standard number of segments
              per circle. 

    REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
        [-c]  Conversion file. ASCII text file specifying the mapping
              of stream layers to Allegro subclasses.

        <brd>  Name of the design file.
