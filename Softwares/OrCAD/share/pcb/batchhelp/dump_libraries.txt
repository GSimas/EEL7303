    Usage:
        dump_libraries -[pdamsflcx] <layout>

    Options:
        -p - dump all padstacks
        -d - dump all device files        (run create_devices)
        -a - dump all package symbols     (.dra only)
        -m - dump all mechanical symbols  (.dra only)
        -s - dump all shape/flash symbols (.dra only)
        -f - dump all format symbols      (.dra only)
        -l - dump all signoise device models
        -c - create .psm, .bsm, fsm, and .ssm files when dumping symbols
        -x - do not dump dependencies
        <no options> - dump all elements  (equivalent to -pdamsflc)

    Notes:
     1) The dependencies of each dumped item will also be dumped.  For
        example, when dumping padstacks, all shape symbols required by
        the padstacks will also be created.

     2) The -x option prevents dumping dependancies. By default padstacks
        that a dra requires are dumped.

     3) The -b option is used by APD to send information from the APD to
        the dump_libraries program about the symbol to be dumped. The -b
        option causes only one padstack and one particular symbol to be dumped
.
        The -b options have three values:
            dump_libraries -b component_refdes -b symbol_name -b padstack_name
	This option is quite different from normal behavior.
